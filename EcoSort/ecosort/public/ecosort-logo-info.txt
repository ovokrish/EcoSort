Please save the EcoSort logo image you provided to this directory as "ecosort-logo.png"

Steps:
1. Save the gradient leaf logo image you uploaded
2. Rename it to "ecosort-logo.png"
3. Place it in the public folder of the project (this same folder where this text file is located)
4. No code changes are required - the index.html file has already been updated to reference this image

Once you've done this, the EcoSort logo will appear in your browser tabs instead of the default favicon.
