// Create a comprehensive waste management knowledge base
const wasteKnowledgeBase = {
  // Plastics
  'plastic bottle': 'Plastic bottles should be emptied, rinsed, and placed in the recycling bin. Remember to remove the cap and recycle it separately as they\'re often made from different types of plastic.',
  'plastic bag': 'Most curbside recycling programs don\'t accept plastic bags. Take them to grocery stores with plastic film recycling bins. Better yet, use reusable bags!',
  'plastic wrap': 'Plastic wrap or cling film is typically not recyclable in curbside programs. Dispose of it in regular trash or look for special plastic film recycling programs.',
  'styrofoam': 'Styrofoam (expanded polystyrene) is difficult to recycle. Most municipalities require it to go in the trash. Check for specialized recycling facilities in your area.',
  'plastic straw': 'Plastic straws are usually not recyclable due to their small size and typically end up in landfills or as pollution. Consider using reusable metal, glass, or bamboo straws.',
  'plastic utensils': 'Plastic cutlery is rarely accepted in recycling programs due to its small size and mixed materials. If possible, use reusable utensils or choose compostable alternatives.',
  
  // Paper
  'newspaper': 'Newspapers are highly recyclable. Keep them clean and dry, then place in paper recycling. Some communities may ask you to bundle them separately.',
  'cardboard': 'Flatten cardboard boxes to save space. Remove any tape, plastic, or styrofoam before recycling. Soiled cardboard (like greasy pizza boxes) should go in compost, not recycling.',
  'magazine': 'Glossy magazines are recyclable, but remove any plastic wrapping first. Some specialty coatings may reduce recyclability.',
  'receipts': 'Thermal paper receipts (shiny, slick paper) contain BPA and should go in the trash, not recycling. Regular paper receipts can be recycled.',
  'shredded paper': 'Put shredded paper in a paper bag before recycling to prevent it from becoming confetti throughout the recycling facility. Some programs may not accept it.',
  
  // Glass
  'glass bottle': 'Rinse glass bottles and recycle without caps. Different colors of glass may need to be separated depending on your local program.',
  'glass jar': 'Remove lids and rinse jars before recycling. Metal lids can typically be recycled separately. Glass is infinitely recyclable without loss of quality.',
  'mirror': 'Mirrors cannot be recycled with container glass as they have different melting points and chemical compositions. Donate usable mirrors or dispose of broken ones in the trash.',
  'drinking glass': 'Drinking glasses, window glass, and ceramics are not recyclable with container glass and can contaminate the recycling stream. Donate usable items or dispose of broken ones safely.',
  
  // Metal
  'aluminum can': 'Rinse aluminum cans and recycle themâ€”no need to remove labels. Aluminum is infinitely recyclable and doing so saves 95% of the energy needed to produce new aluminum.',
  'tin can': 'Rinse food residue from tin cans and place in recycling. You can leave labels on, and in most programs, you can leave the lid partially attached.',
  'aluminum foil': 'Clean aluminum foil can be recycled, but it must be free of food residue. Ball it up to form a larger piece so it doesn\'t get lost in the recycling process.',
  'aerosol can': 'Empty aerosol cans can typically be recycled with other metals, but they must be completely empty. Never puncture or flatten aerosol cans.',
  
  // E-waste
  'battery': 'Never put batteries in regular trash or recycling. Take them to designated battery recycling locations, as they can cause fires in waste facilities. Many electronics stores offer battery recycling.',
  'phone': 'Cell phones contain valuable materials and hazardous components. Many electronics retailers offer take-back programs, or you can donate working phones to charitable organizations.',
  'computer': 'Computers contain valuable metals and hazardous materials. Use manufacturer take-back programs, donate working computers, or take to e-waste collection events.',
  'television': 'TVs contain lead and other hazardous materials. Many retailers offer recycling when you purchase a new TV, or you can use municipal e-waste collection services.',
  'printer cartridge': 'Many printer cartridges can be refilled and reused. Office supply stores often have recycling programs with incentives for returning used cartridges.',
  
  // Organic Waste
  'food scraps': 'Food scraps are ideal for composting. If you don\'t have a home compost, check if your community offers food waste collection or compost drop-off locations.',
  'yard waste': 'Grass clippings, leaves, and small branches can be composted at home or through municipal yard waste collection. Some communities prohibit yard waste in landfills.',
  'coffee grounds': 'Coffee grounds are excellent for composting and add nitrogen to your compost pile. You can also use them directly in garden soil as a fertilizer.',
  'meat waste': 'Meat, bones, and dairy should not go in home composting systems as they can attract pests and create odors. Some municipal composting systems can handle these items.',
  
  // Hazardous Waste
  'paint': 'Never pour paint down drains or place in regular trash. Water-based paint can often be dried out and disposed of in trash, but check for local paint recycling programs first.',
  'cleaning products': 'Use up cleaning products completely or give them to someone who can use them. Never pour down drains. Take hazardous cleaning products to household hazardous waste collection.',
  'medication': 'Never flush medications down the toilet. Use pharmacy take-back programs or community drug take-back events. Some medications can be disposed of in household trash if mixed with coffee grounds or cat litter.',
  'fluorescent bulb': 'Fluorescent bulbs and CFLs contain mercury and should be taken to hazardous waste collection or retailers that accept them for recycling. LED bulbs are more environmentally friendly alternatives.',
  'motor oil': 'Used motor oil is highly recyclable. Many auto parts stores and service centers accept used oil for recycling. Never pour it down drains or on the ground.',
  
  // Special Items
  'clothing': 'Donate wearable clothing to thrift stores or textile recycling. Even worn or damaged textiles can be recycled into insulation or rags.',
  'shoes': 'Donate usable shoes to charities or collection programs. Some athletic shoe companies have recycling programs for worn-out sneakers.',
  'mattress': 'Mattresses are difficult to recycle but many communities have specialized recycling programs. Some retailers offer mattress recycling when you purchase a new one.',
  'furniture': 'Try to donate or sell usable furniture. For broken items, check if your community has bulky waste pickup or if the materials can be separated for recycling.',
  'tires': 'Tires should never go in regular trash. Many tire retailers will recycle your old tires (often for a small fee) when you purchase new ones.',
  
  // General Recycling Concepts
  'contamination': 'Contamination occurs when non-recyclable items are placed in recycling bins or when recyclables contain food residue. This can cause entire batches of recycling to be rejected and sent to landfill.',
  'wishcycling': 'Wishcycling is putting something in the recycling bin hoping it can be recycled, even when you\'re unsure. This good intention actually causes problems by contaminating recycling streams.',
  'compost': 'Composting is the natural process of recycling organic material into nutrient-rich soil amendment. Home composting can divert up to 30% of household waste from landfills.',
  'zero waste': 'Zero waste is a philosophy focused on waste prevention. It encourages redesigning resource lifecycles so all products are reused, with no trash sent to landfills or incinerators.',
  'biodegradable': 'Biodegradable means a material can break down naturally, but doesn\'t specify timeframe or conditions required. Not all biodegradable items are compostable in home systems.',
  'microplastics': 'Microplastics are tiny plastic particles under 5mm that result from plastic breakdown or are manufactured at that size. They\'re found throughout the environment and food chain.',
